Covid-19 World Vaccine Progress
    The world is in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccines save millions of lives each year. Vaccines work by training and preparing the bodyâ€™s natural defences "The Immune System" to recognize and fight off the viruse and bacteria they target. Many vaccines have been developed by different countries for *SARS-Cov 2*
Some of them are listed below:

 ðŸ’‰ Pfizerâ€“BioNTech

 ðŸ’‰ Oxford

 ðŸ’‰ Moderna

 ðŸ’‰ Sputnik V
 
 ðŸ’‰ Covaxin


The Libraries and the functions used for this project were learnt from the course Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas.
